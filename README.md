Financial News Sentiment Analysis Project
This repository contains the code and analysis for the Financial News Sentiment Analysis project. The project aims to analyze a large corpus of financial news data and discover correlations between news sentiment and stock market movements. The goal is to enhance predictive analytics capabilities and improve financial forecasting accuracy.
The project focuses on three key areas: Data Engineering (DE), Financial Analytics (FA), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE).
The analysis should focus on two main aspects: sentiment analysis and correlation analysis.

Sentiment Analysis
Perform sentiment analysis on the 'headline' text of the financial news articles. By utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, derive sentiment scores associated with the respective 'Stock Symbol'. This analysis will help quantify the tone and sentiment expressed in financial news and provide insights into the emotional context surrounding stock-related news.

Correlation Analysis
Establish statistical correlations between the sentiment derived from news articles and the corresponding stock price movements. Track stock price changes around the publication dates of the articles and analyze the impact of news sentiment on stock performance.
Getting Started
